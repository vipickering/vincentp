On [the Google blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html) explaining how Google Duplex works, this line jumps out at me.

<blockquote>
    <p>... To obtain its high precision, we trained Duplex’s RNN on a corpus of anonymized phone conversation data ...</p>

A number of concerns arise from this statement:

- How did Google acquire phone data?
- Anonymised or not, the data must still be real conversations, with real people talking to each other or it would be useless to them.
- In order to continue training the code to pretend to be human in other circumstances Google will need to acquire ever more phone conversation data. This feels quite a contentious issue, especially around consent.

Personally, I would always want to know when I am talking to a machine and when it is a human.
