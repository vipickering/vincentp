I am going to be returning to blogging this year. It's gotten a little dusty around here, so I'm cleaning the cobwebs and fixing up the broken things.

I've removed all the RSS feeds and consolidated them in to one single feed, that will comprise of my articles and notes, I didn't have a lot of people subscribing, but if you were one of those people (thankyou!) you may need to resubscribe to the new feed. 

I enjoyed running an IndieWeb Server and learning so much while doing it, however I have decided to cut down my social media presence online. It's too much to manage and I don't have time to do the things I love. Thankfully when I started that journey I built everything in such a way that I could keep the old content and turn it all off. 

Instead, moving forward, I will post my thoughts and ideas here, with the occasional use of Bluesky here and there when the mood takes me. I am even hoping to try and do month notes if my new schedule allows it.

Some of the re-design will be in the open and you might notice a few dangly bits. Will do my best to keep it respectful :D
