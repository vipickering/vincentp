Creative Creations is a deck of cards I designed to help foster creativity, through bonding, laughter and fun. It can be used as a way to spark creativity, a quick icebreaker, a more formalised training session or just for fun. Play your way, to suit your needs.

Iâ€™ve been testing the current set of cards with adults and kids of all ages, and after a lengthy testing period in both formal and informal settings, version 1 is now ready for release!

You play the game by each player drawing a card from the deck, you then all have 4 minutes to simultaneously write or draw your solution. Once the time is up, people share back one at a time. Super simple to learn, but the results can be quite unpredictable!

The game is available as print and play **[totally for free from my website](/downloads/creative-creations-v1.0.pdf)**, I would love to know how you get on, feel free to reach out and share your creations!

## Print Instructions
The card file is arranged so all you need to do is set your printer to **[print it out](/downloads/creative-creations-v1.0.pdf)** *double sided* and *9 slides on each page*.
You should find the cards line up perfectly.

Alternativey, if you want large size cards print them *double sided* and *1 per-page* for jumbo fun.

- Once the discussion time has expired, a Judge starts a second timer for 30 mins.
- Each team has the 30 minutes to create a convincing pitch for their idea and decide how they will pitch it. You can do this HOWEVER you like from a boring PowerPoint all the way through to interpretive dance, whatever you think will impress the judges the most.
- Once the 30 mins have elapsed, teams are chosen in a random order to present their ideas to the judges.
- After the teams have presented, the Judges write their score (from 1-5) down and all display their verdict together.
- Add the Judges scores together to get the team score.
